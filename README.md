# DegenToken Smart Contract
## Overview
The DegenToken smart contract is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain using the Solidity programming language. This contract includes additional functionalities such as minting tokens, redeeming tokens for items (specifically cars), and burning tokens. The contract is owned by a specific address that has exclusive rights to mint tokens and add new items.
## Features
1. **Minting Tokens:** Only the owner can mint new tokens.
2. **Burning Tokens:** Any user can burn their tokens.
3. **Redeeming Tokens for Items:** Users can redeem tokens for predefined in-game items.
4. **Managing Items:** The owner can add new items or update the prices of existing items.
5. **Checking token balance:** Players should be able to check their token balance at any time.
# Contract Details
## Inheritance
* 'ERC20': Implements the standard ERC20 token functionality.
* 'Ownable': Provides basic access control, where some functions can only be accessed by the contract owner.
# State Variables
* 'mapping(string => uint256) public itemPrices': Stores the prices of items in tokens.
# Constructor
```
constructor(address initialOwner) ERC20("DegenToken", "DGN") Ownable(initialOwner) {
    // Initialize some items with their prices
    itemPrices["Sword"] = 100;
    itemPrices["Shield"] = 50;
    itemPrices["Potion"] = 25;
}
```
* Initializes the token with the name "DegenToken" and symbol "DGN".
* Sets the initial owner.
* Predefines some items with their prices.
# Functions
1. Minting Tokens
```
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
    _mint(to, amount);
}
```
* Mints amount tokens to the address to.
* Can only be called by the owner.
  
2. Redeeming Tokens for Items
```
function redeem(string memory itemName) public {
    require(itemPrices[itemName] > 0, "Item does not exist");
    require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= itemPrices[itemName], "Insufficient balance");

    _burn(msg.sender, itemPrices[itemName]);
    redeemedItems[msg.sender][itemName] += 1; // Record the redeemed item
    emit ItemRedeemed(msg.sender, itemName, itemPrices[itemName]);
}
```
* Redeems tokens for the specified itemName.
* Requires the item to exist and the sender to have enough balance.
* Burns the tokens equivalent to the item's price and emits an ItemRedeemed event.

3. Burning Tokens
```
function burn(uint256 amount) public {
    _burn(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
* Burns amount tokens from the sender's balance.

4. Adding New Items
```
function addItem(string memory itemName, uint256 price) public onlyOwner {
    itemPrices[itemName] = price;
}
```
* Adds a new item or updates the price of an existing item.
* Can only be called by the owner.

5. Checking Redeemed Items
```
function getRedeemedItemCount(address player, string memory itemName) public view returns (uint256) {
  return redeemedItems[player][itemName];
  }
```
* Returns the number of times a player has redeemed the specified itemName.
# Events
event ItemRedeemed(address indexed player, string itemName, uint256 price);
* Emitted when an item is redeemed.
* Logs the player's address, the name of the item, and the price
Usage
1. Minting Tokens
* Only the owner can call the mint function to mint new tokens.
2. Redeeming Tokens for Items
* Users can call the redeem function to redeem tokens for items, provided they have enough balance.
3. Burning Tokens
* Users can call the burn function to burn their tokens.
4. Managing Items
* The owner can call the addItem function to add new items or update existing items.
